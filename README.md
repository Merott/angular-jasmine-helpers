# angular-jasmine-helpers

A small set of helper methods to make testing AngularJS applications with Jasmine more fun. I don't like beforeEach blocks, and find them to make tests hard to follow and debug.

I created this for my own personal use, to keep my tests DRY without using beforeEach blocks and the like. I will continue to iteratively improve this little library as and when I need to.
